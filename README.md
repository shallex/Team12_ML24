## Introduction

Large datasets often contain instances that do not equally contribute to the learning process. These instances may include mislabeled, difficult-to-learn, or redundant samples. Our objective is to minimize the size of the initial dataset by retaining only highly relevant samples. This approach facilitates faster convergence of the model, reduces storage requirements for useful data, and minimizes computational overhead. Our goal is to proactively filter the unlabeled dataset to reduce costs associated with data labeling, while ensuring the final quality of the model remains uncompromised.

## Approaches
